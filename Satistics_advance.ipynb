        "A **random variable** in probability theory is a numerical outcome of a random experiment or process. It assigns a real number to each outcome in a sample space.\n",

        "There are two main types of random variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Discrete Random Variable**: Takes on a finite or countable number of values (e.g., rolling a die).\n",
        "2. **Continuous Random Variable**: Takes on an infinite number of possible values, usually within a given range (e.g., height, weight).\n",
